// Refactor your code from problem set one to use variables. Create a variable for your first name and one for your last name. Print them on separate lines and then try printing them on the same line.

// Assign the following values to variables. Decide how best to name them and if they should be created with const or let. There are a couple ways to think about each one. Write a brief sentence about why you chose the variable name you did and why you chose const or let.

// The year 1776
let year = 1776
console.log(year)
// your age
let age = 31
console.log(age)
// the golden ratio (google this one if you don't know it)
let goldenRatio = 1.61803398875
console.log(goldenRatio)
// the name of your home country
const country = 'USA'
console.log(country)
// The total change due for a $25.76 bill paid for with a $50 bill.
let money = 50
let bill = 25.76
const change = money - bill
console.log(change)
